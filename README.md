# discordjs-voicerole

This is a pluggable package for Discord.js applications and bots. It
will add a guild member to a specific role whenever the member joins a
voice channel, and it will remove the member from the role when the
voice channel is left.

## Requirements

A JavaScript project already depending on Discord.js 13 or Discord.js 14.

**Still trapped in Discord.js 12 and having a hard time upgrading?**
ðŸ‘‰ Stay using discordjs-voicerole 1.0.1, the last version supporting
Discord.js 12. You can pin it in your package.json like this:

    "discordjs-voicerole": "<2.0.0"

Sorry for stating this, but consider upgrading your bot.

## How to use

Import the VoiceRoleManager to use it.

If you are using Node.js and CommonJS. (You probably are if you don't
know):

```js
const { VoiceRoleManager } = require("discordjs-voicerole");
```

If you are using ES Modules or TypeScript, you can make use of import:

```js
import { VoiceRoleManager } from "discordjs-voicerole";
```

Build a VoiceRoleManager. You need to provide a configuration object.
It is an object where keys are the snowflake of a voice channel.
For each key, assign the string of the snowflake of a role to the
array of snowflakes of roles.

When the user joins a channel monitored by the VoiceRoleManager, they
will receive all the roles pointed by their entry in the configuration,
and when they leave the channel, they will have those roles removed.

* To get the ID of a voice channel, right click the channel and use
  "Copy ID". Make sure that Developer Mode is turned on in the Advanced
  Settings.
* To get the ID of a role, visit the server role settings, right click
  the role, and use "Copy ID". Make sure that Developer Mode is turned
  on in the Advanced Settings.

```js
const manager = new VoiceRoleManager({
  "40001": ["20001", "20002"],
  "50001": "30001",
};

// When the user joins the voice channel with ID 40001, the roles with
// the ID 20001 and 20002 will be user, and removed when the channel
// is left. When the user joins the voice channel with ID 50001, the
// role with ID 30001 is assigned to the user and removed when left.
```

To make the library work, simply handle the `voiceStateUpdate` event
in your Discord.js application and call the `trigger` function with
both `VoiceState` objects.

```js
// client may be Discord.js Client, a Commando CommandoClient...
client.on('voiceStateUpdate', (old, cur) => manager.trigger(old, cur));
```
